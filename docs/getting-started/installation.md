# Installation

Ploi CLI can be installed using composer.  
The easiest way to install Ploi CLI is by making it a global composer dependency:

```bash
composer global require schmidfelix/ploi-cli
```

Now you're ready to go and can [save your api token](/docs/ploi-cli/v1/getting-started/authenticating).
