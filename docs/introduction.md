# Introduction

Ploi CLI is the missing link between ploi.io and your local (and version controlled) PHP applications.

It allows you to keep server and site configurations under version control, and makes it easy to apply changes to your ploi provisioned server and sites.

```shell script
ploi token

ploi init

ploi deploy:run
```
