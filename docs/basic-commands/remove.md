# Removing a site

The `ploi remove` command allows you to remove all the config files from your directory, and deletes the site on
your server.

After confirming the remove command, the script will ask you to also delete
the site on ploi. If you choose `yes` all the files will get deleted on your server.

> Be careful with that command, this action cannot be undo.

The configuration file will get removed from your working directory.
